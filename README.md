# ML Code Challenges üåü  
Welcome to my **ML Code Challenges** repository! This project is dedicated to tackling daily ML and deep learning challenges offered by [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/), a platform that provides a range of tasks to strengthen our skills and understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science fundamentals.

This is an ongoing project where I will continuously add new solutions to challenges, exploring a wide range of ML concepts, from linear algebra fundamentals to advanced neural network implementations.

## About the Project  
The ML Code Challenges aim to:
- **Enhance practical ML skills** by working on real-world inspired tasks.
- **Deepen understanding** of core machine learning and deep learning concepts.
- **Encourage consistent learning** with daily challenges covering various difficulty levels, from **Easy** to **Hard**.

Each challenge solution is organized in Jupyter notebooks with code explanations, step-by-step solutions, and documentation for easy navigation and learning.

## Completed Challenges  
Below are the completed challenges so far. This list will grow as I continue to tackle new tasks.  

1. **Solve Linear Equations using Jacobi Method (medium)** [Code](https://github.com/Amir-Tav/ML-Code-Challenges/blob/main/Linear%20Equations%20using%20Jacobi%20Method.ipynb), [Link](https://www.deep-ml.com/problem/Solve%20Linear%20Equations%20using%20Jacobi%20Method)
